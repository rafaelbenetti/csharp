# .NET Framework (3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5)
 - It is a software framework developed by Microsoft to help programmers develop system across .NET Languages as C#, F#, Visual Basic etc.

## CLR (Common Language Runtime)
 - Manages the execution of .NET programs.
 - Converts compiled code into machine instructions which the CPU can execute.

# .NET Framework 3.0 (features)

## Web Services
 - Web services are good for invocation of remote methods on a server from a client. Web services are also standardized, therefore often used in interoperability scenarios. They are called WCF Services.

# .NET Framework 3.5 (features)

## LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
 - The LINQ is a killer feature for other languages and must-have capability once used to work with. 
 - The LINQ is something like a SQL for object oriented programming. 
 - All the operations like sorting, taking top n items, looking for items which satisfy some condition; all this stuff can be made very easily and elegantly in a single line by LINQ.
 
## Entity Framework
 - When you learn LINQ and realize it is much more comfortable than SQL, you want to use LINQ for database queries. Thatâ€™s what the Entity Framework is made for. 

# .NET Framework 4.0 (features)

## Parallel Extension (PLINQ) and TPL (Thread Parallel Library)
 - When you have a lot of work to do, it is worth to use a task-based approach. Split the work into many small tasks and run them as you need. Run them sequentially or in parallel, but without managing threads. 
 - The Parallel class takes care of processors count and the efficient number of concurrent threads. 

## Dynamic Language Runtime
 - You can use a dynamic type when you need to interact with type lacking environment, dynamic languages or whatever. 

# .NET Framework 4.5 (features)

## Async / Await
 - Asynchronous programming was always possible in .NET.
 - With Async/Await it is very easy to program in async.

## GC (Garbage Collector) performance improvements
## Named parameters
 - Named arguments free you from the need to remember or to look up the order of parameters in the parameter lists of called methods.
    ```cs
    CalculateBMI(weight: 123, height: 64);
    ```
## Optional parameters
 - The definition of a method, constructor, indexer, or delegate can specify that its parameters are required or that they are optional.
    ```cs
    public void ExampleMethod(int required, string optionalstr = "default string", int optionalint = 10)
    ```
