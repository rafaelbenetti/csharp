# Concepts
 - The functional approach: creating a new, modified version of the original structure.

## Immutable
 - An immutable object can NOT be changed after it's created.
 - It's a way of create Thread Safe applications.
 - It also increse the performance time.
 - Reduce the numbers of bugs, because the application is more secure.

## Mutable
 - A mutable object can be changed after it's created. 
 - It's NOT Thread Safe because process can modify it during the execution.
 - Perfomance problems, because as a reference type uses more memory to manage.
