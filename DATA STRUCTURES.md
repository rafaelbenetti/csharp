## What is Data Structure?
- It's a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified.
- It's a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Abstract Data Types (ADT)
- Define data and operations, but no implementations.

## Array
- It's a data structure consisting of a collection of elements.

```js
const fruits = ['banana', 'apple'];

fruits.map((f) => console.log(f));
```

# What is an Algorithm?
- Used as a tool for mathematical computation.
- Algorithms are deeply connected with computer science, and with datastructures in particular. 
- An algorithm is a sequence of instructions that accomplishes a task in a finite period of time.
